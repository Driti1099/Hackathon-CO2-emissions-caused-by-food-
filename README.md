CAPTION DE-CARBON

Vision:
Our team of five hackathon participants is dedicated to addressing one of the most critical global challenges: reducing the carbon footprint of the food supply chain while promoting healthier eating habits. We believe that empowering consumers with real-time information about the environmental and health impacts of their food choices can drive positive changes. As a result, we have developed an innovative app that not only provides detailed nutritional information but also highlights the environmental impact of food items in terms of their CO₂ emissions. The app also recommends healthier and more sustainable alternatives, giving users the tools they need to make informed decisions.

Problem Statement:
The food industry is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the form of CO₂. The production, transportation, and processing of food contribute significantly to global warming, but consumers often lack information on how their food choices affect the environment. At the same time, poor dietary choices contribute to lifestyle diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart conditions.
Our solution bridges this knowledge gap by providing consumers with a simple yet powerful way to scan, search, and compare food products based on their carbon footprint and nutritional profile, promoting healthier and environmentally friendly alternatives.

How the App Works:
1. QR Code Scanning and Search Functionality:
•	Scan: Users can simply scan the QR code or barcode found on food packaging using the app’s built-in scanner.
•	Search: Alternatively, they can search for food items manually by name or category.
•	The app then retrieves and displays key information about the product, such as:
o	Percentage of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, fiber)
o	Micronutrients (calcium, iron, vitamins)
o	Calories per serving
o	CO₂ emissions associated with the production of the food item, displayed in grams or kilograms.



2. CO₂ Emission Data:
•	The app provides users with the CO₂ footprint for each food item, helping them understand the environmental impact of their food choices. This information is sourced from a database from Kaggle.

3. Healthier and More Sustainable Alternatives:
•	Alternative Suggestions: Once the user scans or searches for an item, the app provides healthier and more eco-friendly alternatives. These recommendations are based on both nutritional and carbon metrics.
o	For example, if a user scans butter, the app might suggest alternatives, which have a lower CO₂ footprint and a healthier nutritional profile (lower in saturated fat and cholesterol).
o	The alternatives are compared side by side with the original product, highlighting:
	Nutritional improvements (higher fiber, lower fat, more vitamins).
	CO₂ reductions (e.g., “this product emits 60% less CO₂ than your current choice”).

5. Detailed Nutritional Breakdown:
•	The app provides a full breakdown of the macronutrient and micronutrient composition of each item:
o	Proteins: Percentage and sources (plant-based or animal-based).
o	Carbohydrates and Fiber: Including refined and whole grains, and the associated glycemic index.
o	Fats: Saturated and unsaturated fat levels.
o	Vitamins and Minerals: Highlighting deficiencies or excesses in daily recommended intake.
•	This information is especially valuable for users with specific dietary needs, such as people managing diabetes, heart conditions, or pursuing plant-based diets.

6. Comparison and Reporting:
•	The app allows users to compare the CO₂ and nutritional impacts of various food choices, side by side. It may also offer features like:
o	“Weekly CO₂ savings report” showing how much CO₂ the user has avoided by choosing lower-emission alternatives.

Expected Impact:
1.	Environmental Benefits:
The app offers CO₂ data and sustainable alternatives, encouraging lower-impact food choices and reducing the global carbon footprint
2.	Health Improvements:
Our app promotes healthier food choices by suggesting alternatives that are lower in unhealthy fats, sugars while being higher in nutrients like fiber, protein, and essential vitamins. This can help mitigate lifestyle diseases and improve overall well-being.
3.	Increased Consumer Awareness:
One of the primary goals of our app is to educate users about the hidden environmental costs of their food. By making this data easily accessible, we hope to shift consumer behaviour toward more sustainable consumption patterns.

Conclusion:
In summary, our hackathon project addresses both environmental sustainability and public health by empowering consumers with crucial information at the moment of purchase. With the growing focus on reducing carbon emissions and improving dietary habits, our app is perfectly positioned to help users make informed, healthier, and more sustainable food choices in an easy, accessible way.
We believe this app can play a pivotal role in promoting climate-conscious eating habits and fostering a future where both people and the planet can thrive.
